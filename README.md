Master's Thesis on abstraction-based Reinforcement Learning in a maze environment. Heavily based on Jergéus and Oinonen's work in:   
Jergéus, E., & Oinonen, L. K. (2022). Learning Abstractions via Reinforcement Learning [Master's Thesis, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg]. Chalmers Open Digital Repository. 

The runs can be watched by running:
`python watch_model.py`  
and follow the instructions given by the terminal to watch.

If you would like to train your own model, run the following:
`python training.py`  
and follow the instructions given by the terminal.

The results can be found on Weights and Biases. Please contact the owner of this repository if you're interested.
